Scattering media(e.g. diffuser, fog, biological tissue) on the light path will causing the degradation of images. With the help of wavefront shaping, abberation brought by scatter media can be cancelled by iteratively optimizing the compensation phase on the SLM(Spatial Light Modulator). The difference between scattered image and diffraction limited image on image gradient can replace invasive guide-star to guide the optimization, reconstructing high contract images.
